# How To Run Tests For This Collection

## Local Testing

The collection needs to be cloned to a path of ansible_collections/chipy/decoder_ring for ansible-test to work correctly.

The first type of test to run is called the sanity test and requires no additional configuration to run it. Just type:

```bash
ansible-test sanity
```
